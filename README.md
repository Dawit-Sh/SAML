# SAML
SAML is a very simple BASIC-like programming language for simple math operations. I developed it while still in high school so I don't remember much about the inner workings, but it's a good example of a simple language in action.

It's been a while since I've done any C++ code since I'm a web developer now, but I still remember how to compile this. First compile the DLL using CodeBlocks or your own method and make sure the ".a" static library is in the "lib" folder. Then you can compile the shell which accepts commands and reads source files.

I might return to C++ programming and make another follow-up language later on down the road, but for now...web development is my career :)
